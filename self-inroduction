Hi! my name is Mark. It’s my short life story. I’m from Brest in Belarus. I’m 25 years old.  
I have finished university last year. My specialty is economy. 	
I’m a beginner in programming. I have been on quarantine for 3 weeks last summer. 
I felt myself alright and I didn’t know how I can spend this time. I’ve decided to try programming. 
I found courses on YouTube about Html&css on channel of Andrew Andrievskiy. 
I have got base of layout because of this courses.  I didn’t think about working in IT at that moment. 
It was just my passion on quarantine. But my friend told me about RS School this winter. 
He finished it, and he is frontend developer now.
Therefore I discharged from my work, and learning programming, because there was no ways to grow up at my work, 
and my salary wasn’t high. I want to get job in programming, because there is a lot of ways to rise. 
Already I have some skills in html css. Now I’m learning java-script. 
It’s not easy for me, but I believe that nothing is impossible. 
Node JS, Git, RSApp, NPM and other things that I have never use before especially take a lot of time to understand how it work. 
There is a lot of information, different technologies, tasks, tests… now my brain is mush. 
I didn’t done every task of Rs School course because it’s take a lot of time to understand how write code of different functions. 
Sometimes I spend the whole day to write a function, which don’t works…
So I added links of my tasks Wildlife and Online Zoo in video description. But Online Zoo is not finished yet. It’s has only layout. 
My English level is Pre-Intermediate (CEFR A2+). It’s my result of Streamline school test.
